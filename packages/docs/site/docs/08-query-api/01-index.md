# Query API

WordPress Playground exposes a simple API that you can use to configure the Playground in the browser.

It works by passing configuration options as query parameters to the Playground URL. For example, to install the pendant theme, you would use the following URL:

```text
https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant
```

You can go ahead and try it out. The Playground will automatically install the theme and log you in as an admin. You may even embed this URL in your website using an `<iframe>` tag:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?theme=pendant"></iframe>
```

It uses the WordPress Importer, so the default admin user must be logged in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For example, the following code embeds a Playground with a preinstalled Gutenberg plugin, and opens the post editor:

```html
<iframe src="https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=elementor&url=/wp-admin/post-new.php&mode=seamless"> </iframe>
```
